Both simulate a hierarchical tree structure representing a collection of nodes with each node representing a value,
they are quite different from each other in terms of how they can be implemented and utilized.
A Binary Tree follows one simple rule that each parent node has no more than two child nodes,
whereas a Binary Search Tree is just a variant of the binary tree which follows a relative order to how the nodes should be organized in a tree.
