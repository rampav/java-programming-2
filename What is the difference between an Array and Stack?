Difference Between Array and Stack
Definition
An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements each identified by the array index.
In contrast, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two principal
operations: push and pop. Thus, this is the main difference between Array and Stack.

Data Types
Also, another difference between Array and Stack is that an array contains elements
of the same data type while a stack contains elements of different data types.

Basic Operations
Furthermore, basic operations of an array include insert, delete, modify, traverse,
sort, search and merge while basic operations of the stack are push, pop and peek.

Access Elements
In an array, any element can be accessed using the array index. However, in a stack, 
only the topmost element can be read or removed at a time. Hence, this is also a
difference between Array and Stack
