A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree with the following properties:

1)The left subtree of a particular node will always contain nodes whose
keys are less than that node’s key.

2)The right subtree of a particular node will always contain nodes with keys
greater than that node’s key.

3)The left and right subtree of a particular node will also, in turn,
be binary search trees.
